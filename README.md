# Medor
Medor is a time tracking tool.

It serves two purposes:
  1. Provide me with a time tracking tool that does exactly what I want.
  2. Teach me about some useful technologies.

As a result, it's probably a bit bloated. I'm not sure anyone really needs a time tracking tool that uses dbus.
Who knows, it's a jungle out there.

It's a work in progress.

## TODO
* Remove giomm and call freedesktop notifications directly. 
* Git / Hg hooks and CLI for hinting? 
* Show commits in reports
* Verify concurrency in SQLite
* Warnings when stopped on a weekday during work hours?
* Add a comment field to activities?
* Interface to edit / delete activities / add past activities
