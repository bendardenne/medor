# Medor
Medor is a time tracking tool.

It serves two purposes:
  1. Provide me with a time tracking tool that does exactly what I want.
  2. Teach me about some useful technologies.
  
As a result, it's probably a bit bloated. I'm not sure anyone really needs a time tracking tool that uses dbus.
Who knows, it's a jungle out there.

It's a work in progress.
